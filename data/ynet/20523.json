Walls fall, holes filled, railings painted. Welcome to anti-disengagement central.    \u201cAny IDF soldier that tries to come in here will quickly understand who we are,\u201d 29-year-old Itamar Ben-Gvir says, the \u201cforeign minister\u201d of the hotel.    Several times this week, police arrested a settler from the settlement of Kfar Tapuah, considered one of the most radical in the West Bank, on suspicion he was involved with the Shabbat attack.    Back at the hotel, people are sure the incident will speed up the security forces\u2019 decision to take control of the hotel.    Hope for hundreds more   The hotel\u2019s population covers a wide range. There are dozens of singles, together with 30 families.Young marrieds live next door to large families.    One family, the Gubsteins from Kiryat Arba, have brought their seven children, the oldest of whom just celebrated his bar mitzvah.    The owners hope to bring hundreds more before the army declares Gaza a closed military zone, in preparation for the upcoming withdrawal..    There is no hot water, so \u201cguests\u201d shower with water heated on the stove. Dinner is served in a central dining room entire families live in small rooms only recently vacant and neglected. Some people go to work every day, some work on laptop computers in their rooms.    Gaza Absorption Authority    Aryeh and Datia Yitzhaki, residents of Kfar Yam and heads of the Gaza Absorption Authority (a play on words meant to mimic the government\u2019s Gaza Disengagement Authority), rented the hotel with the intention of turning it into a symbol of opposition to the withdrawal.    Most of their time is spent trying to convince soldiers to refuse orders to clear out settlements and pushing their cause on the internet.    The army has set up a post right across the street. Around the hotel, many people are convinced there are informers in their midst.    \u201cIt\u2019s completely see-through,\u201d Ben Gvir says. \u201cThere are spies and Shin Bet operatives dressed up as photographers. I hope they work differently with the Arabs,\u201d he said.    Ready for anything   Ben Gvir also says he knows the army could place him under administrative detention.    \u201cIt is very possible (the government) could try to neutralize me and (fellow Kach leader) Baruch Marzel,\" he says. \"But there are others to take our places. We are ready for anything.\u201d    When asked if his followers will fire on IDF soldiers participating in the pullout, he avoids the question.    \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for everyone or to make promises I can\u2019t keep. But it\u2019s the other side (the IDF) that\u2019s likely to shoot first,\" he says. \"There\u2019s no doubt Sharon will try to use snipers here. And I have certainly considered the possibility they will try to take me out.    \u201cHaving us in the hotel scares Sharon and (Defense Minister Shaul) Mofaz. But they would be wise to understand that the minute they act against us, there will be many \u201cMaoz Hayams,\u201d he says.   Itamar\u2019 s 18-year-old wife Ayala Ben Gvir is even more strident than her husband.   \u201cSome of our people are armed, and you can be sure they will not hand in their weapons in order to cooperate with Sharon,\" she says. \"Our goal is to make the evacuation so bad that for the next 200 years no Jew or non-Jew will even consider kicking Jews out of their homes and throwing them in the rubbish.\u201d    What's not to like?   So how many people are there at Maoz Hayam? It\u2019s tough to know.    According to most estimates, there are hundreds. Many are children who look happy in their new home, and why not? There\u2019s a beach, soccer field and swimming pool. Back home in the West Bank they are considered heroes and the front line soldiers in the war against disengagement.    But once in a while you can hear them ask their parents what will happen in less than two months. As we prepared to leave, one little girl asks her mother, \u201cMommy, will the police also arrest my teddy bear?\u201d", "title": "\u05e6\u05e2\u05e6\u05d5\u05e2 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6: \u05d4\u05db\u05e0\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d8\u05d5\u05df", "url": "http://xnet.ynet.co.il/diy/articles/0,14712,L-3102891,00.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "xnet", "published_time": "", "category": "", "subtitle": ""}
