He\u2019s in favor of a Palestinian state but has no faith in its leadership. He believes Israel\u2019s pullback from Gaza will be interpreted by the Palestinians as a forced withdrawal, but says the intifada will not resume once the project is complete.   Dichter, 53, says he supports the disengagement, and disagreed with former Chief of Staff Moshe Yaalon's prediction that Palestinians will re-kindle the intifada once Israel leaves Gaza.    \"The apocalyptic prediction has no basis in intelligence findings,\" he said. \"There is no reason they would return to terrorism. Why would they?\"   He also rejected the notion that despair would push them to return to terrorism.   \"They are getting the whole territory. There is no reason for Hamas to renew attacks. I don't envision a thrid intifada in September,\" he said.   In the dark   Dichter says the intelligence community kept in the dark in the period leading up to the Oslo accords, and is sharply critical of the way the entire process was handled.    \u201cIsrael gave them the whole (Gaza) Strip, but the gesture was interpreted as weakness. We thought our gesture would be met with a matching one from the Palestinians, but it never happened.\u201d    He also says the writing was on the wall for the intifada as early as 1995, but the political establishment chose not to react.    \u201cIn 1996, 16 soldiers were killed by Palestinian fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe asked (then- Prime Minister Shimon) Peres to give them an ultimatum to stop firing. He said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d    Asked his opinion of the Oslo process now, says it was a mistake for Israel to take \u201cbig steps\u201d while only demanding \u201clittle steps\u201d from the Palestinians. And he is sharply critical of the decision not to include the security establishment in the process.    \u201cThe whole process was secret. Very few security officials were involved, out of fear they would scuttle an agreement. They thought that the train would run smoothly once it was up and running, but it just didn\u2019t happen.    \u201c(Oslo) solved some problems, but created more than a few new ones,\u201d he said.    Clear Conscience    Dichter says he has a clear conscience regarding the targeted assassination policy he directed from 2002 to 2004. He points to the example of Salah Shehada, a Hamas terrorist killed by a one-ton air force bomb in Gaza in July 2002 that also killed 16 civilians.    \u201cI don\u2019t know how many Israelis paid with their lives for our decision to put off that strike,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people died as a result of our decision to use a smaller bomb on a Gaza building where the entire senior command of Hamas was meeting. We used a smaller bomb, and they all got away.\u201d    At the end of the day, Dichter is optimistic. He points to his IDF service in an elite reconnaissance unit as an example for the entire country.    \u201cI learned in the army there is no limit to human capability. You can always do more. And there is no limit to the things this country can accomplish.\u201d", "title": "\u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea: \u05d0\u05e6\u05dc \u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05dc \u05e0\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05df", "url": "http://xnet.ynet.co.il/fashion/articles/0,14539,L-3097510,00.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "xnet", "published_time": "", "category": "xnet_fashion", "subtitle": ""}
