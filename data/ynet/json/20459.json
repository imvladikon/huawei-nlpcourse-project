By year four, I got so sick of it that I bluntly told him he had to get me something because it was really embarrassing when people asked what I\u2019d gotten and my answer was, \u201cNothing.\u201d    So he did - a box of chocolates. Only, when he gave them to me, he was like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry they\u2019re unwrapped, but I already ate one.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat?!\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d finally been thoughtful enough to buy me a present, yet he\u2019d ruined the moment by eating one of the chocolates. That was when I opened the box and noticed, in the missing chocolate\u2019s place, he\u2019d slipped a ring. - Katharene Johnson, Ridgecrest, California   Don't be cheap   I once had a date use his student ID to buy tickets when he had been out of college for seven years.   - E.B., Atlanta, Georgia   Don't talk about the following things, unless you know the woman and know she is also interested in the thing you\u2019re talking about: baseball, The Grateful Dead, former girlfriends, your mother, your car, your cell phone, golfing, and politics.    What should you talk about? Her. Ask lots of questions about what she likes, about her job, about her family, about where she has traveled. The more she talks, the better you\u2019re doing.   - M.J. Twetten, Chicago, Illinois      Sex    I look for \"lingering\"     If she leans in to say something and stays close, that can be a sign. Of course, that could also be because we\u2019re in a noisy place, or maybe she likes the smell of my fabric softener, or the professor of the class she skipped this morning just walked into the cafeteria and she\u2019s moving behind me to remain hidden.     Basically, anything short of a come-hither look or stripping leaves me with at least a few doubts.   - Chad Makaio Zichterman, San Francisco, California   Getting intense    If you have a chance to meet the mother, do it. The way a guy treats his mother is the way he\u2019s going to treat you.   - Stephanie Hacker, South Beach, Florida   Don\u2019t freak out about when to say, \u201cI love you.\u201d There\u2019s no right timetable for these words. My husband told me he loved me two weeks into our relationship, when we were hiking Mt. Holy Cross in Colorado.     You could tell it just sort of slipped out of his mouth instinctively, because right after he said it, he got this embarrassed, \u201cOops, I didn\u2019t mean to say that!\u201d grin on his face. But I\u2019m glad he did, because for us, the timing felt right.  - Wren Johnson, Centennial, Colorado   You know you\u2019re serious \u2026when you look through the list of people you\u2019ve called on your cell phone, and the last 10 numbers are all the same.   - Emily, Louisville, Kentucky   Learn to appreciate love for what it really is. I had a boyfriend of two years whom I got along with excellently and who made me very happy. However, he never did any of those spontaneous and wonderful things that \u201cmovie boyfriends\u201d (and sometimes real-life ones) do.    For a long time I thought that he didn\u2019t love me because he failed to buy me flowers and shower me with compliments. However, when I found myself in a hospital alone in a foreign country, he was the one by my side, taking care of the paperwork, sleeping on a plastic chair by my bed and calling my mother to calm her down. These are the meaningful things, the true signs of love that a million flowers cannot pretend to be.    - Rebecca Kazzaz, Bethesda, Maryland    Excerpted from \"How to Survive Dating,\" published by Hundreds of Heads Books.
