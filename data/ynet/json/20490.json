The stabbing victims were evacuated to Shaarei Tzedek Hospital one of them is listed in light condition, while two others sustained light to moderate wounds.   Thirteen religious Jews were arrested for attempting to block the parade's path.   Some 100 ultra-Orthodox arrived at the corner of Hahistadrut and Ben-Yehuda streets and attempted to attack the marchers as the parade made its way to the area, and police forces tried to disperse them forcefully.    The ultra-Orthodox waved banners reading, \u201cHomosexuality is abnormal\u201d and \u201cHomosexuality is not an incurable disease and may be treated with psychiatric care.\u201d    The marchers, in turn, waved signs reading, \u201c100 percent bisexual\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t worry, be gay.\u201d    The participants, numbering several thousands, adorned rainbow-colored outfits, and some came in drag.    The parade was allowed to go ahead after the District Court ordered Jerusalem Mayor Uri Lupoliansky to reverse his decision on the matter.    Jerusalem District Police Chief Ilan Franco said the attacker is an ultra-Orthodox Jew in his 30\u2019s with no a police record. The man was taken in for questioning and an indictment will be filed against him, he said.   Major-General Menashe Nahum, the commander of Jerusalem\u2019s Oz Police Station, said, \"We noticed a man in ultra-Orthodox attire run frantically toward the front end of the parade. He had a horrific look in his eyes.\"   \"As he was running he raised his hand and scuffled with one of the marchers. A number of officers lunged at him, and it was then that we noticed he was holding a large instrument in his hand. At first we could not tell it was a knife he man who was stabbed fell to the ground, and we nabbed the assailant,\" he said.   Shinui Party Chairman Yosef Lapid called the incident a \u201cvile attack,\u201d saying it was the result of \u201cthe unruly incitement by rabbis and ultra-Orthodox community leaders against those who are different than them and who do not live according to their doctrine.\u201d   Equality in Jerusalem   \u201cWe came to show our support for Jerusalem,\u201d Tel Aviv resident Yaniv Weitzman of the \u201cProud Youth\u201d organization said. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s reaction only increases the parade\u2019s importance.\u201d    Hagay Elad, the director of the Gay grassroots organization \u201cJerusalem Open House,\u201d said the violence is \u201ca direct result of the incitement that took place during the past few weeks against the homo-lesbian community.\u201d   \u201cThis is not the first time we see how incitement in Israel leads to physical violence, which begins with (Jerusalem) Mayor Uri Lupoliansky and his associates,\u201d he said.   Elad said the parade organizers took the pullout-related violence into account when they had decided to go ahead with the march.   \u201cWe have decided to cancel the international parade that was scheduled for August due to the disengagement plan and postpone it until next year, so it cannot be said that we are not being considerate,\u201d he said.   Parade participant Maayan Amiazar said that for her the parade is a celebration of democracy.   \u201cI invited (to the parade) more straight friends than members of the community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is very important that the judicial system proved there is equality in Jerusalem as well.\"", "title": "\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05d4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d3\u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05ea\u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05db\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea", "url": "http://xnet.ynet.co.il/design/articles/0,14563,L-3106491,00.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "xnet", "published_time": "", "category": "xnet_design", "subtitle": ""}
