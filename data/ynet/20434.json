Eival Giladi told reporters during a briefing Wednesday.    \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy of hurting the civilian population to create a deterrence effect,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we won\u2019t hesitate to hurt terror elements.\u201d    \u201c\u201dWe\u2019ll strive to be as accurate as possible and we\u2019ll act on up-to-date intelligence information, but collateral damage could happen and innocent people may be hurt,\u201d said Giladi, who is the pullout\u2019s strategic coordinator at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow terror elements to act in the midst of the civilian population.\u201d   Giladi said the harsh message was clearly relayed to Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas during his summit meeting with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in Jerusalem Tuesday.    In addition, Abbas was told Israel would hold him largely responsible for the security situation that prevails during the disengagement plan\u2019s implementation.   \u2018Israel to maintain freedom to act\u2019   Meanwhile, Giladi dismissed previous warnings by outgoing Army Chief Moshe Yaalon, who said the pullout would be implemented under the shadow of growing terrorism.   \u201cThere is no intelligence assessment that can be used to base the claim there will be more terror,\u201d Giladi said. \u201cThe estimates are highly dependent on the way we act. If we do nothing, it could happen.\u201d   He also pointed to other assessments, including that offered by outgoing Shin Bet Chief Avi Dichter, which point to an expected decline in terror.   \u201cI have no doubt that since the (disengagement) plan was created, terrorism has been on the decline. The effect it brought about was a reduction in terror,\u201d Giladi said.   Moreover, Israel would not lose the freedom to act following the pullout, he said, noting \u201cthere is no military operation we can do today and won\u2019t be able to do in the future.\u201d   \u201cWe\u2019re not naive enough to think the disengagement\u2019s realization would end terror, but we hope the plan would creative motivation to reduce it,\u201d Giladi said.", "title": "\u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05e9\u05dc \u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d9: \"\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05e0\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05db\u05e9\u05de\u05ea\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05e8\"", "url": "http://xnet.ynet.co.il/fashion/articles/0,14539,L-3102464,00.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "xnet", "published_time": "", "category": "", "subtitle": ""}
